      <p style="font-family: Arial black; font-size: 20px; color:rgb(255, 51, 0);" >My name is Satyam Mishra. I am studying in class 10th, my school is ST.Norbert school. I am belonging to state: Uttar Pradesh, District: Deoria, Village Amoan Gaon. I am currently living in State: Madhya Pradesh, District: Indore. This is my first introductory website to all of you. If you guys want some help of how edit background change Font, Font colour and to embeed links and images in your website too so you can take a help from my Github repositories by the given link. Now the question will raise in your mind what is Github and Github repositories? see Github is the place where you can save your codes which you have writen in Visual studio code or in Note pad it will safely keep your codes in your repositories suppose if you saved file is deleted from the local drive so you get your file from here. Git repositories is the place where you can see the changes which you have made in your saved file. You can push your codes in the github repositories by doing the following steps:
      <br>
           1) First go to your Visual studio code terminal
      <br> 2) Then in the folder where your file is saved you have to type the command in terminal 
      <br>    for example: cd windows
      <br>     this step you ave do until you reached that folder where your file is saved
      <br> 3) Then you have to type these three commands:
      <br>    git add .     
      <br>    git commit -m " "
      <br>    git push. 
      <br> after doing this you can refresh your git hub repositorie and can see the changes which you have made in code. I hope that it is clear to Everybody.
